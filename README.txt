i used netbeans to make a new maven java application and
	-changed the pom file to include selenium webdriver
	-changed the pom file to build an executable jar (needed to build jar w dependencies)
	-changed the pom file to also build an executable jar w dependencies
	-did that java thing
	
*this could also be used as a test in a test package as part of a larger application
